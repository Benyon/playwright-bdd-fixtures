Feature: Date Input Validation
  As an employee who works regular hours
  I want to be informed of incorrect data passed into the holiday calculator
  So that I can correctly answer the questions asked

  # These tests heavily rely on understanding the requirements for validation.
  # I have noticed in the scenario where an irregular houred employee is asked when their leave year start
  # The date input will accept any input for the year.
  # I'm going to make an assumption that this is intentional, and not a bug.

  # Another case where requirements would clear this up, it seems any value will be accepted in the year field on irregular hours.
  # This one is most likely intentional as that data is probably not needed, but a full date input field would be a better UX.
